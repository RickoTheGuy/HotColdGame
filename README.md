# ðŸ”¥ Hot Cold Game (With a Rude AI)

A sarcastic number guessing game where the AI roasts you for every wrong guess.  
No hints, no mercy â€” just heat levels and disrespect.

---

## ðŸŽ® How It Works

- The AI secretly picks a number between **1 and 100**.
- You try to guess it â€” and get **verbally destroyed** based on how far off you are.
- Feedback levels include: `on fire`, `hot`, `warm`, `cool`, `cold`, `freezing`, and `lost`.

The AI will:
- Trash talk you in a custom **intro**
- Drop heat or shade after every guess
- Clown you in a **savage outro** (if you even make it that far)
- Accuse you of **cheating** if your guesses start looking suspicious ðŸ‘€

All AI messages are generated live with OpenAIâ€™s GPT API.  
The bot is 100% rude â€” by design.
