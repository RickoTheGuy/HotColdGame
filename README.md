Hot Cold Game (With a Rude AI)

A sarcastic number guessing game where the AI roasts you for every wrong guess.
No hints, no mercy — just heat levels and disrespect.

 How It Works

The AI secretly picks a number between 1 and 100.

You guess it — and get roasted based on how far off you are.

Feedback levels include: on fire, hot, warm, cool, cold, freezing, and lost.

The AI will:

Trash talk you in a custom intro

Drop heat or shade after every guess

Clown you in a savage outro when (or if) you win

All AI messages are generated with OpenAI’s GPT API. The bot is 100% rude — by design.

Requires OpenAI API credits. If you run out, the bot shuts up.

Don’t take anything the AI says personally — unless it’s right.
